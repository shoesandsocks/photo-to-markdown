      <h2>About Photo Markdowner</h2>
      <p>
        Navigate to the `/admin` page. There you can edit the date (it will hopefully be populated
        with the photo's creation date, if your pics have valid EXIF encoded in
        them), and add a title, description, and tags.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you submit an entry, it is validated and converted to a markdown
        file, ready to be copied into your .md-capable blog. Markdown files should start to pop up in
        the `markdown-posts` folder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obvious(?) note: Your blog's markdown files are different from mine; adjust the template at the top
        of `src/mdMaker.js` as appropriate - whatever frontmatter you want, whether you want
        more/other content in the body of each post... it's maybe not for beginners, but I think
        it's easy enough for a hobbyist to figure out. For that matter, it wouldn't be too
        tough to add additional fields to the form then use the data from those fields in the
        `mdMaker.`
