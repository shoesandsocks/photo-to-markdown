      <h1>How it works; how to change things</h1>
      <p class="body-p">
        It's a Node.js app you run locally. Clone it from the <a href="#">Github repo</a> and
        type <code>npm start</code>.
      </p>
      <p class="body-p">
        Put the photos you'd like to 'process' in the <code>public/photos</code> folder
        and click on the Admin page. There you can edit the date (it will hopefully be populated
        with the photo's creation date, if your pics have valid EXIF encoded in
        them), and add a title, description, and tags.
      </p>
      <p class="body-p">
        When you submit an entry, it is validated (to some extent) and converted to a markdown
        file, ready to be copied into your .md-capable blog. The markdown files themselves will be
        in <code>/markdown-posts</code> and the images will be in <code>/assets</code>.
      </p>
      <h2>The template doesn't match my blog</h2>
      <p class="body-p">
        You can tweak the template; it's at the top of the <code>/src/mdMaker.js</code> file.
        (It's a fairly simple frontmatter and body template. Be careful with the newlines.) 
      </p>
      <h2>The data doesn't come out right</h2>
      <p class="body-p">
        I wrote this for myself and there are some date and text validations (and some lack-thereofs)
        that work for me. All the bits that manipulate data coming in from the photo and the form
        are inside the mdMaker function, ready to be tweaked.
      </p>
      <p class="body-p">
        (One thing in particular you might want to change; if you don't put any tags in the form
        when you submit it, the mdMaker will insert an <code>-auto-generated</code> tag. You could
        change that to something else. I ran a big batch of dog photos and used that default setting
        to add the dog's name to every post's tags without having to type her name over and over
        on the Admin page. There's also a default alt-text for images.)
