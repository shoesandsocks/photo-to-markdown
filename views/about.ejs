        <h2>About Photo Markdowner</h2>
        <p>
          Put your photos in the <code>public/photos</code> folder. Navigate to the <code>/admin</code> page.
          There you can edit the date (it will hopefully be populated
          with the photo's creation date, if your pics have valid EXIF encoded in
          them), and add a title, description, and tags.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you submit an entry, it is validated and converted to a markdown
          file, ready to be copied into your .md-capable blog. Markdown files should start to pop up in
          the <code>markdown-posts</code> folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obvious(?) note: Your blog's markdown files are different from mine; adjust the template at the top
          of <code>src/mdMaker.js</code> as appropriate - whatever frontmatter you want, whether you want
          more/other content in the body of each post... it's maybe not for beginners, but I think
          it's easy enough for a hobbyist to figure out. For that matter, it wouldn't be too
          tough to add additional fields to the form then use the data from those fields in
        <code>src/mdMaker.js</code>.
        </p>
        <h2>Other thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          There's not a lot of input sanitization here; this is code a person runs locally for
          their own benefit -- I doubt anyone would vandalize their own project, but if there are
          any genuine errors or file-writing problems, I'd like to know about them and work on fixes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Copies of each photo are also saved in the same folder as the markdown posts, because
          that's how I organize <a href="https://www.rich-text.net/stream">my Gatsby blog</a>.
          Consequently, the markdown template's relative path to the image is simply
          <code>./filename.jpg</code>. You could save all the images to a separate photos folder,
          and tweak the template to include the correct relative path. Again, maybe not a beginner
          task, but not impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combining both of the paragraphs above: This code <b>is potentially destructive</b>; the original
          photos are removed from the photos folder, and <b>should be</b> copied into the markdown
          folder, but <b>maybe</b> something goes wrong? I hope not, but plan accordingly.
          Back up your priceless memories before you run them through this thing...
